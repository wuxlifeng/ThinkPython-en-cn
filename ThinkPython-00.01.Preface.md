#Chapter 0  Preface 前言
##The strange history of this book
> ##本书的奇幻历史

In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.
>在1999年1月的时候呢，我正准备教一门Java的入门编程课。
我当时已经教过三次了，挫败感很强。班上挂科率特别高，而且即使那些没挂科学生编程整体水平也特别低。

One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.
>当时有很多问题，我首先发现的就是教材。那些教材都特别大部头，有很多关于Java的细节，特别琐碎又并不重要，而且也没有足够的关于如何编程的高层次指导（译者注：就是缺乏战略性指导，没有告诉学生编程的心法）。这些教材总有一些『陷阱门效应』：开头他们都却是挺简单，然后逐步提升，接着突然在某个地方，比如第五章，出现很坑很复杂的陷阱。学生们要突然一下子应对太多新东西，甚至措手不及，而我作为教师就得花费整个后半个学期来一点点给学生们补上。

Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:

*	Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.
*	Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and define each term at first use.
*	Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.
*	Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.

I needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.

开课的两周之前，我最终决定要写个自己的教科书。目标如下：

*	简短。让学生读10页就够比让他们读50页效果好得多。
*	降低词汇难度。我尽量把术语用量降到最低，并且在首次使用的时候对每一个都进行定义。
*	循序渐进。为了避免『陷阱门效应』，我专门把这些最为复杂的部分抽离成一个个专题，并且都切分成小规模的部分，一步步来进行。
*	专注于编程，而不是编程语言。我只保留了关于Java的最小规模内容，没有涉及更多的细节。
我还需要个标题，就突发奇想，选了个标题叫做『如何像计算机科学家一样思考』。

My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.
>我的第一版教材很粗糙，但挺管用。学生真能看进去，并且理解了我在课上所讲的那些难点和有趣的专题，最重要的是，他们能够据此来实践。

I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.
>之后我就以GNU自由文档协议来发布了这本书，这一协议允许所有人去复制、修改以及分发这本书。

What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I published the first Python version in 2001.
>接下来的事情很有趣了。Jeff Elkner，维吉尼亚的一位高中教师，他很欣赏我这本书，把这本书从Java翻译成了Python的版本。他发给我一份『译稿』，然后我开启了阅读『自己的书』来学习Python的奇妙经历。于是在2001年，我通过Green Tea Press出版了本书的第一个Python版本。

In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.
>在2003年，我开始在奥林商学院教学，并且第一次开始教Python了。这和Java的对比很鲜明。学生们省力多了，学得也更多了，在有趣的项目上也更努力，整体上都觉得这一学习过程很有乐趣。

Since then I’ve continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises.
>从那以后，我就继续维护这本书，修正错误，改进样例、附加资料以及练习题。

The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title Think Python. Some of the changes are:

*	I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.
*	I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects. Most exercises include a link to my solution.
*	I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion.
*	I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.
*	I added appendices about debugging and analysis of algorithms.

>结果就产生了现在这本书，现在标题简化了很多——Think Python。主要的改变如下：

>*	在每一章的末尾，我加了关于debug的部分。这些内容提供了关于debug的一些整体策略，比如如何找到和避免bug，还有就是关于Python一些陷阱进行了提醒。
>*		我加了更多的练习，从简单的理解方面的测试，到一些比较充足的项目。大多数练习都有解决方案的样本链接。
>*		我还添加了一些案例研究，包含练习、解决方案和讨论的更大规模的样例。
>*		此外我还扩展了关于程序开发规划和基本设计模式的讨论。
>*		关于debug和算法分析，还额外加了一些附录。
	
The second edition of Think Python has these new features:

*	The book and all supporting code have been updated to Python 3.
*	I added a few sections, and more details on the web, to help beginners get started running Python in a browser, so you don’t have to deal with installing Python until you want to.
*	For Chapter 4.1 I switched from my own turtle graphics package, called Swampy, to a more standard Python module, turtle, which is easier to install and more powerful.
*	I added a new chapter called “The Goodies”, which introduces some additional Python features that are not strictly necessary, but sometimes handy.

>这本Think Python 的第二版有如下的新内容：

>*	本书内的所有参考代码都升级到Python3了。
>*	我增加了一部分内容，以及一些关于web方面的细节，这是为了帮助初学者能够在浏览器中开始尝试Python，这样即便你不想安装Python也没问题了。
>*	在第四章的第一节，我把我自己的一个原来叫做Swampy的小乌龟图形包转换撑了一个更标准的Python模块，名字叫做turtle，更好安装，功能也比之前强大了。
>*	我还添加了新的一章，叫做『彩蛋』，介绍了一些Python的额外功能，严格来说，这些功能并不算必备的，但有时候蛮好用的。

I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think like a computer scientist, at least a little bit.
>我希望大家能享受学习这本书的过程，也希望这本书能帮助大家学习编程，并且让大家学会像计算机科学家一样思考，哪怕有一点点也好。
